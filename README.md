Data and analyses for Eckland et al. (2023)

This repository contains spreadsheets and Jupyter notebooks that were used for the analyses in Eckland et al. (2023).

It contains three major folders, each of which contain another README file with information about each file/dataset:
1. Field_Data
2. Hydro_Data
3. Notebooks

The **Field_Data** folder contains the field data, which were processed in the laboratory and/or collected via instrumentation, as well as spreadsheets used for the various analyses in the paper.

The **Hydro_Data** folder contains csv files of publicly-available hydrologic data collected by the US Geological Survey (USGS) and Texas Water Development Board (TWDB). 

The **Notebooks** folder contains Jupyter Notebooks used to both generate various figures in the paper and to compute sediment fluxes in the Rio Grande over different time periods.
