The **Field_Data** folder contains data collected in the Rio Grande Delta upstream of Elephant Butte Reservoir (EBR) between July 2021 and September 2022. It also contains Excel spreadsheets that were used to conduct analyses of sedimentation rates within EBR and its delta. Each file name contains the following information: figure number in Eckland et al. (2023) in which this data is presented, an underscore, and a brief heading of the type of data the file contains.

The filenames and descriptions of each file are given below:

- Site_Locations.xlsx: contains latitude (X) and longitude (Y), WGS84 in decimal degrees, for all sampling locations and sites. 

- Fig4_SSC-OM.csv: contains Suspended Sediment Concentration (SSC) and Organic Matter Content (%) data from sediment-water samples, which are used to build Figures 4a, 4b, 4c, and 4d (see Notebooks folder).

- Fig4_SS-GSD.csv: contains Grain Size Distribution (GSD) data for all sediment-water samples collected from the Rio Grande channel, which are used to build Figure 4e (see Notebooks folder).

- Fig4_Bed-GSD,csv: contains GSD data for all bed material samples collected from the Rio Grande channel, which are used to build Figure 4e (see Notebooks folder).

- Fig7_Reservoir_CTD-SSC.xlsx: contains water stratification data for EBR near the mouth of the Rio Grande, including Conductivity, Temperature, and Depth (CTD) casts, and SSC data for the top and bottom of the reservoir water column. This spreadsheet is used to build Figure 7.

- Fig8_AllSamples_SSC-OM-GS.xlsx: contains SSC, OM%, and GSD statistics, like median grain size (D50), for all samples collected over the study period for all sample types. This spreadsheet is used to build Figure 8. 

- Fig9_Qs_EstAggRates.xlsx: contains the anaysis of historic and recent reservoir aggradation rates. It contains sediment fluxes from the Rio Grande into EBR from 1957-2016, partitioned by year, decade, and season (computed in Jupyter Notebook: Figure9.ipynb). It also contains the average water level during each time period, which was used to compute the average inundated reservoir area (as described in Eckland et al., 2023). It also contains information on how dam trapping efficiency was computed for each decade. This spreadsheet is used to build Figure 9.

- Fig10_ZS_ObsAggRates.xlsx: contains the analysis of observed deposition and erosion across EBR between 2007 and 2017/2019, generated from USBR bathymetry surveys. It contains the outputs from the Zonal Statistics tool in QGIS, which was used to determine the mean, standard deviation, and sum of deposition and erosion in EBR between 2007 and 2017/2019. It also contains the calculations for aggradation and carbon burial rates for each polygon, as described in Eckland et al. (2023).

- FigS2_PC.xlsx: contains data and analysis for computing grain size distributions of gravel bars at two river sampling sites. This spreadsheet is used to build Figure S2.

- CTD_files: folder that contains the CTD files, including folders for all files collected during the study period (“All”) and for the files used to generate Figure 7 only (“Fig7”)

- Sonar_files: Contains sonar data for the March and May 2022 field trips. These data are presented in Figures 6b and 6c. 

- Tidbit_files: Contains raw tidbit data at each deployment location: Control, FPT1_1, and FPT1_3. These files are used to generate Figure S3.
