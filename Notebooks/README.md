The **Notebooks** folder contains Jupyter Notebooks used to generate several figures in Eckland et al. (2023). This folder also contains another folder called “Saved_Figures”, where the figures developed in the code are saved.

Figures developed using Jupyter Notebooks include:
- Figure 2 (a, b, and c)
- Figure 4 (a-e)
- Figure S3
- Figure S4 (f)

The file called “Figure9.ipynb” was used to sum up the incoming sediment load during each decade, year, and season, which were then imported into the spreadsheet called “Fig9_Qs_EstAggRates.xlsx”, located in the “Field_Data” folder, for further analysis.
